                        <h2>The Problem</h2>
                        <p>Driving has always been a problem for most: 
                                tiredness after a long day of work, 
                                high cost of fuel and parking, 
                                heavy traffiic along side with the pollution ... 
                            It tightly relate to our day-to-day life and our future environment. </p>
                        <p>Carpool, in our opinion, is a great way of solving these problem. 
                            By creating a way for people to carpool to work, we can reduce the number of cars on the road, and subsequently the carbon emissions we have. </p>

                        <p>CarpoolRide is an app that designed to help users find reliable people to carpool with. 
                            It focuses on finding passengers and drivers that match a person’s preferences. It also allows for clear communication of rating systems for drivers and passengers, whether it be by ratings, reviews, or other methods.</p>

                        <h3>Questionnaire-based Survey</h3>
                        <p>We utilized a questionnaire-based survey to explore different factors that people may consider important when using transportation methods. At the same time, we want to use these quantitatively data to learn about the common reoccuring practices people have when carpooling</p>
                        

                        
                        <h3>Semi-Structured Interviews</h3>
                        <p>We conducted 5 interview to breakdown different aspects of carpooling, such as the importance of community and why people choose to carpool or not. 
                            Having a semi-structured approach allows us to tailor the interview to focus on the aspects the participant considers important (safety, finance, etc).</p>

                        <h3>Insights - 4 Major Themes</h3>
                        <h4>Safety</h4>
                        <p>Safety is especially relevant when carpooling with people you aren’t that familiar with, such as friends of friends or complete strangers.</p>
                        <h4>Personal Preferences</h4>
                        <p>Personal preference is a underlying factor in the decision of ending a carpool. In particular, understanding the driver’s driving habits, riders' preferred car’s temperatures, car's cleanliness, and even music tastes all contribute to carpoolers’ happiness and comforts.</p>
                        <h4>Time Schedule</h4>
                        <p>The concept of matching schedules and flexible times was a major recurring theme in both the semi-structured interviews and survey results. 
                            Participants do not feel comfortable about modifying their own or the other carpoolers’ schedules.</p>
                        <h4>Transportation Convenience</h4>
                        <p>Convenience was repeatedly mentioned as a key factor in the decision to carpool. The convenience of carpooling could depend on the cost, people they ride with, and taken time.</p>

                        <p>We designed the following six tasks based on the major themes. These tasks are iterated and revised throughout our design proess. 
                            Our team uses these tasks to inform our design choices.</p>

                        <h4>Decision</h4>
                        <p>We chose to pursue our first design centered around finding and matching with individuals, based on their preferences. 
                            It enforces the concept of "safety" and "comfort" by allowing clear communication between drivers and passengers, writing ratings and reviews, etc. 
                            Many participants also cited things such as heavy traffic and missing bus schedules as pain points of their current transportation method. 
                            From this, we would like this design to communicate a reliable yet flexible schedule.                        </p>
                    </div>

                        <h2>Storyboarding</h2>
                        <h3>Task 1 - Finding suitable carpoolers</h3>
                        <p>Our user research overwhelmingly showed that people wanted to know their carpooling group first before the carpooling experience. 
                            They focused a lot on having a network of reliable passengers through filtering with background checks for security and not random strangers. 
                            When asked the most important factor when deciding to carpool with someone, almost every participant mentioned “comfortability with other passengers”, “relationship”, and “reliability”. 
                            This is why we chose to center around the design based on finding suitable carpoolers.

                        <h3>Task 2 - Communicating live updates</h3>
                        <p>Most of our research participants mentioned that delays and unexpected scheduling changes were the main problems with their carpooling experiences. 
                            We wanted to make sure this is included in our design as our targeted participants of students and working professionals mentioned that schedule changes and road-related delays were common.
