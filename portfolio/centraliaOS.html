                        <h2>The Context</h2>
                        <p>Centralia Car OS is designed as my class project for Mobile Application Design (INFO 365). 
                            This class challenges us as designers to create an unique UX operating system that could be imagined to be on any physical devices.
                            In the 3-month duration, we are asked to go through 15 potential application for our operating system based on our design language and design principle.
                            Our team was the only team in the class that decided to challenge ourselves by creating an unique car user experience. 
                            Hope you enjoy reading our journey.
                        </p>

                        <p>Centralia Car OS is a futuristic example, which provides a wholistic driving experience through apps
                            designed for every step of the journey, creating interactions both
                            in and out of the car.</p>
                        <p>It utilizes the car’s windshield, a console screen, and personal smartphones to create a seamless, multimodal driving experience.
                            Through thoughtful designs and trackings across physical devices, Centralia uses ride-related personal data to provide a better user experience for both drivers and passengers.</p>

                            “Essential” creates a unique experience for drivers that incorporates intuitive & responsive designs to promote safety. 
                            It becomes one with the road and one with you.</p>

                        <h3>Research & Literature Analysis</h3>
                        <p>In order to develop a Car OS that is comfortable for our users, our team decides to look for what has already been built on the market. 
                            Through our research and literature analysis, we pull out the following elements that drivers found helpful or distracting from the existing car practices.
                            To communicate emotions, we added colored sticky notes: Blue - Informative, Green - Foundamental, Yellow - Unsure, Orange - Try to Avoid.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Ideation</h3>
                        <p>Based on our research and team brainstorm, we wrote out key words on the whiteboard and draw connections. 
                            Through this process, we were able to identify common themes and use these to drive our design decisions. </p>

                        <h3>User Journey</h3>
                        <p>Based on what we have know, our team designed a driver's user journey, which divides the user experience into three stages: before trip, while driving, and post trip.</p>
                        <ul class="center">
                            <li>

                                <h3>Before Trip</h3>
                                Drivers can prepare for a trip through their smartphone and continue to make adjustments in the car through the console screen.</li>
                            <li>
                                <div class="icon-container"><span class="icon-map-pin"></span></div>
                                <h3>While Driving</h3>
                                Drivers could interact with Centralia OS through either the console screen or vocal commands.</li>
                            <li>
                                <div class="icon-container"><span class="icon-map-pin"></span></div>
                                <h3>Post Trip</h3>
                                Drivers may use functionalities on their smartphone to improve their future driving experience.</li>
                        </ul>
    
                        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                        <p>We found out that by projecting car statistics onto the windshield, it ensures the drivers safety by decreasing the frequency of the drivers lowering their head. 
                            To figure out the exact position, we read through several eye tracking research and conducted several rounds of usability testing with our team members using paper prototype. 
                            In the end, we agree on putting it on the lower center of the screen as it appears to be the most non-intrusive way for the drivers.</p>

                        <p>Every single one of our app are design through lots of iterations, especially at the beginning when we have not contructed our UI component library.
                            In fact, we went through a lot of changes - from windshield to console screen, from gestures to tapping actions. 
                            Due to the fast-paced of the course, we also had to make smart choices on our design choices, figuring out important parts of the design that convey most. </p>
